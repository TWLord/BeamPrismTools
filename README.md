# DUNEPrismTools

## Overview

This package contains tools for producing inputs for, and developing a
PRISM-style analysis. These are split into three distinct stages: neutrino
flux input generation, neutrino interaction simulation and final state
propagation, and event selection, systematic propagation, and PRISM prediction
production.

See [dox/DUNEPrismTools.md](dox/DUNEPrismTools.md) for detailed description and
documentation.
